# getreleases
Easily get releases and links to them for Git related tools

There should be one line per release in the output like:

```
[GitLab Patch Release: 10.3.1](https://about.gitlab.com//2017/12/27/gitlab-10-3-1-released/)
```

or

```
[2.10.14](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/2.10.14)
```

Yeah, the output uses the Markdown format.
